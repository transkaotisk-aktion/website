<h2>Soup Kitchen</h2>

<p>Show up on February 11 for Transkaotisk Folkekøkken, our new bi-weekly community dinner initiative! You will receive free food and have a cozy time (bring coziness). Everyone is welcome. If ya want leftovers, bring a container.

One or several representatives of the repair/technical group will be present and Reperationskonsortiet is open on Wednesdays, if you need help fixing something. See ya on the 2nd and 4th Wednesday of every month. Check our IG story for updates on the day (where we will give notice if we ever have to cancel).
