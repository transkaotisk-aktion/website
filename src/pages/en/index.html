      <p>Being trans is vulnerable. Every trans deserves to live and thrive, no matter what the cis world thinks of us. We are different from each other, but we are united by the neglect that we experience from the state and society every single day. We are denied the means to live and especially to thrive (when it comes to homes, work, healthcare and more).

This is why we want to foster a community, in which we lift each other up. We want to build and share the necessary resources for living a good trans(human)life, without conditions. We are not getting the support, care and recognition that we need from anyone else.</p>

      <p>The institutions of the cis-world want to decide who the real trans are, how they feel, and what they need. The limited acceptance and support that we have reached in Denmark is fragile too. We don’t trust that it is here to stay: Fuck ‘em.

We have to secure our own needs &mdash; no matter what the state, the law and cis-Denmark thinks about that. We need access to food, shelter, life-supporting medicine and treatment and human connection. No conditions.</p>

      <h3>III.<br>Transchaos is<br>gender trouble</h3>

      <p>Let’s be gender-confused and -troubled, about ourselves and each other. Transchaos makes space for all of it without the need for any of it to make sense or fit together.

Transchaos is to be loud and play and make trouble. It is fun to play with gender, but we don’t play for fun: Play is life-giving and creates a world made for us. And we embrace that world when it is looked at as a threat.

Transchaos is gender trouble and gender vandalism!

<em>MAKE TROUBLE, TRANS!</em></p>
