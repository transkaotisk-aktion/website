<h2>Paper Jams</h2>

<p>Transkaotisk Forlag invite you to a recurring workshop to write, draw, and make transchaotic zines!

Transchaotic PAPER JAMS, every Thursday at AMOK, starting at 15.

At least one person from Transkaotisk Forlag will show up to host the jam, and anyone can join to work on their own thing or collaborate with others.

There isn't any constraint on what sort of thing you can work on. Several folks are working on pieces about CKI.
